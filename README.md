## Abstract
Jewelry is an ancient form of adornment that initially consisted of stones, animal teeth, bones, and shells. Now, it is dominated by metallic compositions, with gold being the most prominent. Our design goal for this capstone project is to improve the fatigue life and durability of our metals rings to enhance usability despite multiple adjustments. We will use advanced mechanical testing and materials characterization to analyze the properties of gold and silver plated rings. Specifically, a combination of hardness, fatigue, microstructural, and compositional analyses will be performed. Through X-ray fluorescence, Vickers Hardness Testing, and density experimentation, we determined that the bulk material of the rings is ùõº- Brass. X-ray fluorescence analysis of the rings concluded that the rings composition was 65% copper and 33% zinc, which aligns with the composition of ùõº- Brass. The Vickers hardness value (~150 HV) and the density value (9.70 g/cm¬≥) of our rings further confirm that the material is ùõº-brass. Through scanning electron microscopy imaging and optical microscope imaging, we were able to measure the average plating thickness for the silver and gold samples. For the gold sample, we obtained values of 15.24 ¬± 8.25 Œºm and 11.39 ¬± 3.18 Œºm from optical microscope imaging and scanning electron microscopy, respectively. For the silver sample, we obtained values of 22.27 ¬± 5.29 Œºm and 21.30 ¬± 7.00 Œºm from optical microscope imaging and scanning electron microscopy, respectively. Overall, the average plating thickness values were found to be consistent across optical microscope imaging and scanning electron microscopy imaging. Heading into the next quarter, we will continue our fatigue and corrosion testing setups and make the necessary adjustments to achieve our design goal. To reach this goal, we plan to perform a combination of annealing and shot peening/cold-working techniques.

## Design Goal
This projects goal is to enhance the usability and fatigue durability of the rings so that they can be used for a longer period of time despite multiple adjustments.
